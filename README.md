### An example of the kind of loud, destructive virus that was around in the 80s. 
This is a COM file infector that would very easily be detected on modern systems. It is *virtually useless* against modern system defenses, but it provides insight into how malware was developed in the days of its inception. The techniques the virus uses are not completely obsolete, however. As viruses developed, newer, more inconspicuous tactics were utilized to thwart anti-virus systems. Many of which could still be used in modern malware. To be able to identify and make sense of them all, one needs to understand how and why each of these tactics became necessary. 


## Disclaimer 
Even though this code would be effortlessly defeated by modern systems, it is still illegal to execute this on someone else's computer without their explicit permission.
